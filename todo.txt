Things to do :

EDITORS BUGS
--> Review empty nodes rule ? :
	* a node is empty only if it contains a text node with \u00A0.
	* when deleting the last inline child, add textnode with \u00A0
	* idem when adding, remove this \u00A0 (look at use of exchangeElementNodes to replace remove element and insert element
--> There are some problems with the new line command.
--> DoWrite function is bugged when redoingActions (focusOffset decal)
--> Some problems with the newline command (to much BR n' nbsp).
--> doDelete and doBackward problems with multilevel lists
--> When doing a selection, toolbars aren't refreshed.
--> Adapt toggleTable function to editor actions
--> To avoid perf problems, use selected element.elementstyle caching

EDITORS CORE CHANGES

- cleanup preferences
- use bookmarks and history to autocomplete url and suggest document anchors too
- find a way to include the dictionnary to the editor actions.
- Should think on a way to display scripts, maps area, objects, noscript etc...
- Find a way to make the content of particular html element undeditable (in order to make representation of element structures like youtube videos).
- GetSelectedElement should cache selected element while no changes in the selection is done.
-> Low priority
- look for image resize functions into FF for resizing images before uploading them.
- maybe increment margin-top when user try to create new paragraph in an empty paragraph instead of alerting users.
- maybe we could do a "table of contents generator" in popup folder using document titles.
- maybe use image url autocompletion too with the help of navigator cache
